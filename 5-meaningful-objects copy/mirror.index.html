    <h1>My Mirror</h1>
    <p>This mirror is special to me because it was hung up in my childhood bedroom up until my sister and I got our own rooms. I took the mirror with me though and have had it hung up in every room Iâ€™ve moved into throughout my life. I think this mirror is absolutely beautiful and always reminds me of my childhood and my sister. The mirror matches my aesthetic pretty well and I think it makes for good wall decor as well. </p>
