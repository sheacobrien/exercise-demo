    <h1>Mexican Hummingbird</h1>
    <p>Another gift from my girlfriend… can you tell what her love language is? (lol) My girlfriend is from Mexico City, Mexico and gifted me this Mexican Hummingbird called an “alebrijes” where she got at from a small market. She gifted all of our friends one of these but said the hummingbird was the most special and meaningful. I love this piece of art and think its beautifully painted and crafted. Its hard to transport because its so fragile so I try and take really good care of it!</p>
