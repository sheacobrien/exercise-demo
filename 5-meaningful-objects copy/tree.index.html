    <h1>Tree of Life</h1>
    <p>I got this Tree of Life wall decoration from this small store off the side of the highway in Lincoln City, Oregon. I used to go to the Oregon Coast with my friends twice a year and those memories of us at the beach together will always be so special to me. Every time we would go to the beach we would make sure we stopped at this store, which doesnâ€™t have a name, and get a trinket. The man that works at the store sources all of the products from local vendors. Similar to the mirror I have, I bring this Tree of Life with me in every room I move in to. It reminds me of home, my friends, and all of our special moments at the beach. a</p>
