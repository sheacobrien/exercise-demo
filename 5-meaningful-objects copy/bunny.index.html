    <h1>My Jelly Cat Bunny; She doesn't have a name right now</h1>
    <p>My girlfriend and I were in this store on Haight called “Your Favorite Store” and I pointed to this bunny and said, “I want that! Next time I have money I’m going to get it.” The next day she came to my apartment and set it on my bed and I was so excited about it! The bunny is special to me because it reminds me of her and a special moment we had together. I also just love to sleep with stuffed animals at night and it looks really cute on my bed. </p>
